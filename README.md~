**Set Game**
========

**



**Description**
-------------

This is a implementation of Set the card game using Ruby.
In Set a deck of 81 cards is used that vary with four features (number, color, symbol and shading)
A set in this game occurs when three cards satisfy all these conditions:
All three cards have the same number or they all have different numbers
All three cards have the same symbol or they all have different symbols
All three cards have the same shadings or they all have different shadings
All three cards have the same colors or they all have different colors

Example of a set is:

1 green striped diamond

2 green solid diamond

3 green open diamond

Once the game has started, enter the number of players playing the game. As this point, 12 cards will be shown on the screen.

If there is no set then more cards will be added.

Whoever sees a set first enters the command to find set. The command will be explained detail as you read through.

If those three cards are a set then that player gets a point. 

The three cards are removed from the game and three new cards are added to bottom list of the displayed cards. If no set exists, then 3 more cards are added until a set is possible.

Once all 81 cards have been exhausted and there are no more sets on the displayed cards, the game ends.

The game then displays the winner (Player with most points)
